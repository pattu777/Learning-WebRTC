Learning WebRTC the Hacker way

WebRTC is dominating the world of streaming. This seems to be the current best standard to do p2p communication between two clients. The hacker way of learning anything is to build and break stuff using it.

So I'll try to build some projects and learn WebRTC along the way.

# Projects
* A simple chatroom application
* Add file sharing capability
* Add video conferencing b/w two clients of the chatroom
* Video conferencing b/w multiple clients
* Video conferencing b/w a browser and a mobile app
* Video conferencing app with capability to share one's screen
* A dashboard to visualize WebRTC metrics
* Video conferencing app where one client can control other's screen
